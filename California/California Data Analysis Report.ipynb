    "\n",
    "For each of the six measurement, we compute the percentate of the variance explained as a function of the number of eigen-vectors used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Percentage of variance explained.\n",
    "![VarExplained1.png](myfigs/pca1.png)\n",
    "We see that the top 5 eigen-vectors explain 38% of variance for TMIN, 59% for TOBS and 47% for TMAX.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude that of the three, TOBS is best explained by the top 5 eigenvectors. This is especially true for the first eigen-vector which, by itself, explains 48% of the variance. TMAX and TMIN also have a pretty good approximation using the first five eigen vectors since they contribute to a significant share of the total variance. On the whole it can be inferred that the temperature statistics follow a pattern with majority of the variance along a few principal axes.\n",
    "Based on this initial promise, we will dig deeper into the PCA analysis of TOBS. However we can expect that the TOBS data is going to be noisy since the temperatures on consecutive days of the year do not follow a strictly increasing or decreasing sequence over a considerably big window. \n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "![VarExplained2.png](myfigs/pca2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 5 eigenvectors explain only 16% of the variance for PRCP. On the other hand the top 5 eigenvectors explain 72% of the variance for SNWD and 68% for SNOW. This means that these top 5 eigenvectors capture most of the variation in the snow signals. However this is not statistically significant since the majority of the weather stations are located in parts of California where it never really snows. As we can see from the below graphs the mean snow depth is close to zero for major parts of the year apart from minor spikes. Also the top three eigen vectors remain zero almost the whole year except for a few sporadic spikes. This means that any reconstruction using the top few eigen vectors will will get 70% of the data correct simply owing to the fact that the snow is zero always. \n",

    "The below graph shows a plot of the cumulative distribution function of the first three residuals. As expected the residual2 is better than residual1 since the first two eigen vectors combined capture more variance than the first eigen vector alone. In other words the residual error from reconstruction using only the first eigen vector grows faster than the residual error from reconstruction using the first two eigen vectors combined. However we can see that there is not much difference in the cumulative residual errors of res_2 and res_3. This behaviour is as expected,conforming with what we saw in the percentage variance explained plot of TOBS, where the increase in the percentage of variance explained between 2 and 3 eigen vectors is very small.<br/>\n",
