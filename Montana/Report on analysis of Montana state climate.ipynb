    "The above histogram shows a plot of the significance of data. The values show the correlation values between various stations. The sudden spike observed at 0.4 can be attributed to assigning a value of 0.4 to the diagonal elements (correlation between the same station). Apart from this spike, the data resembles a normal distribution. \n",

    "The above figure shows a heatmap of the correlation probability values. We observe that there are alernating points of dark and white. Given the objective is to cluster points with similar correlation values, we need a way to group the dark patterns together. The 54x54 matrix corresponds to correlation of 54 stations with each of the other 54 stations. In order to check spatial similarity in correlation values between weather stations, PCA is applied to the matrix shown in the above figure. We take the first 4 eigenvectors of the P_norm matrix and try to cluster data. In order to facilitate this, we sort the components of the first eigenvector of the decomposition and rearrange the stations according to the indices of the sorted eigenvector. \n",

    "If we look at the figure at the bottom left box, we notice a (13,13) square clustered together in blue with small yellow patches among them. This is a representation of stations with similar correlation values and are potentially correlated together. We now plot the geographical spread of the stations to check for spatial similarity. The latitude and longitude data of the correlated stations are taken and plot using gmplot library.We can see that among top 13 most correlated stations, 3 of them are slighlty further away from the remaining 10 stations. This is because of the few yellow patches that we had in the (13,13) square in the bottom left corner of the previous figure. This shows that the stations which are all very close together share comparative snow depth values. \n",

    "An alternate method of visualizing the data is to plot the weather stations along with the coefficients of the first principal components. The below geo plot indicates the principal components by triangles with the size of the triangle representing the magnitude of the coefficient and the opacity of the triangle representing the sign of the coefficient (filled triangles for negative and un-filled triangles for positive coefficients). As we can see there are a few close weather stations with similar triangle structures,that is, similar principal components.\n",
